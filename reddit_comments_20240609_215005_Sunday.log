I've put them next to each other on the bookshelf. Nobody has caught my joke yet...

I'm not an Arch person, but I do use the Arch wiki and consider it one of the finest works ever assembled.

It is a true masterpiece.

Being very serious, it might be time to go to Windows or Apple.

Second, your question is almost useless - read this: [http://catb.org/\~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Now, we can offer generic advice.

* Take photos, or at worst, make a video of what you are seeing
* At the "manufacturers logo" hit ESC. It will show you what happening
* Never ever turn your PC off without shutting it down first. It will cause a data corruption.
* The probable reason why it took forever to boot is it was fixing all the problems from before. DO NOT interrupt it.
* Lastly, run this in a terminal: `sudo systemd-analyze blame`  It will give you a sexy output of what is taking the time to start up. With that, we can help diagnose.
* Next, run this: `sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain` It will show you what comes in what order and where the real delay is
* Each of these are important and useful to write down

.........


Here is the output example of the commands above.

*I can see that the BIG WAIT for me is the NetworkManager. If I didn't know why this delay was occurring* *^((which I do))* *then it would let me target what to do next.*

Here is one **that should be a tool** ^((full disclosure, I just did this for myself))

* Provides a list of directories, the file count and the total file size.
* Format of output: size - count - dirName
* Pretty format output
* Inputs of:
   * Depth as $1
   * Directory as $2
* Bonus points for sorting option!
   * $3 columnName
   * $4 sortOrder

**edit - more detail**

I feel its absolutely excellent that Linux isn't "ageist" but capability-driven.

Here, age is a meaningless construct. We are here both as learners AND teachers.

It fills me with joy to help everyone, answering complex questions, solving difficult problems.

I did this once in PHP. It was good fun.

It was to import photography of children's clothes for a website.

Next, write a report of the images with ugly transformations... Using sqllite as the db ðŸ™ƒ

Message your small hosting company and say you are looking for a bash project.

They ALL have a backlog of job automations and performance rewrites longer than the Magna Carta.

"Free?", they'll say.... Here are 30 projects that have been on the critical list for a decade....

It adds a lot of flavour to the command line. It has a lot of interesting features that aide learning.
